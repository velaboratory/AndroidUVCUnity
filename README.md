This is an example of using the [UnityUVCPlugin](https://github.com/velaboratory/UnityUVCPlugin) to view cameras and stream them over motion jpeg.  
There's also a simpler example of just putting the first thing you find on a quad.
By default, the cameras stream on ports 8080+N, where N is the order you open them.  

Roadmap
* Save previous configuration
* Allow for more camera controls
* Set streaming ports instead of incrementing
